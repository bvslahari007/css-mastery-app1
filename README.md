## About the Project

This is a learning-based project created by following a structured CSS tutorial.  
From the full course, **only App 1 is implemented here** as part of my practice and revision.

The aim was to understand how CSS properties behave in real layouts rather than just memorising syntax.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to **EdRoh** for creating such a clear, practical, and beginner-friendly CSS course.  
The learn-by-building approach made complex CSS concepts much easier to understand and apply in real projects.  
This project would not have been possible without his structured guidance and high-quality teaching.
